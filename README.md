# Sillion Technologies - Technical Test Project

## Overview

This repository contains the technical test project for Sillion Technologies. The project consists of a custom PCB designed using Altium Designer, featuring a 16x2 I2C display, a button, and a 5V motor. When the button is pressed, the motor is activated for 10 seconds, with control managed by an ESP32 microcontroller.
